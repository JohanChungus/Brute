### Use of DDoS attack tools can have significant legal and ethical implications, and can result in serious consequences for both the attacker and the targeted systems and their users. Therefore, I would strongly advise against using such tools for any purpose without proper authorization and consideration of the potential consequences.


 Python script for a DDoS (Distributed Denial of Service) attack tool called "Brutalize". The tool floods a target IP address with UDP packets, causing network congestion and potentially making it unavailable to legitimate users.

The script prompts the user to enter the target IP address, port (optional), bytes per packet (default 1250), and number of threads (default 100). It then initializes a Brutalize object with these parameters and starts the attack by calling the flood method.

The flood method starts a thread to send packets and another thread to display attack information. The send method continuously sends packets to a randomly generated address consisting of the target IP and a random port. The info method displays the attack's throughput and total sent data in Mbps and GB, respectively.

The stop method sets a flag to stop the attack, and the randaddr and randport methods generate random IP addresses and port numbers, respectively.

The main function is responsible for parsing user input, creating a Brutalize object, and starting the attack. It also handles exceptions and stops the attack when the user presses Ctrl-C.

It's important to note that using this tool to launch a DDoS attack is illegal and unethical. The code should not be used for any malicious purposes.
